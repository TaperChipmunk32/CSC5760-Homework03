Problem 1 (30pts/24pts):
Write an MPI program that builds a 2D process topology of shape P ×Q. On each column of processes, store a
vector x of length M , distributed in a linear load-balanced fashion “vertically” (it will be replicated Q times).
Start with data only in process (0,0), and scatter it down the first column. Once it is scattered on column 0,
broadcast it horizontally in each process row. Allocate a vector y of length M that is replicated “horizontally”
in each process row and stored also in linear load-balanced distribution; there will be P replicas, one in each
process row. Using MPI Allreduce or MPI Allgather with the appropriate communicators, do the parallel
copy y := x. There should be P replicas of the answer in y when you’re done.
