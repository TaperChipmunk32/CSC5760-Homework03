Problem 4 (28pts):
1. (8pts) Using the results of Problem #1 and #3 to compute the dot product of two distinct vectors of
length M , one stored initially horizontally in linear load-balanced distribution, and one stored initially
vertically in linear load-balanced distribution. The scalar result should be in all processes at the end
of the computation.
Hint: You can do the copy operation shown in Problems #1 and #3 to make this much easier.
2. (8pts) Modify the exercise with one stored in linear load-balanced distribution, and the other in the
scatter distribution.
3. (12pts) Compute the Matrix-vector product of an M × N matrix A stored on the P × Q grid with
linear load-balanced rows and columns with a vector of length N stored horizontally over the same
process topology. Explain the distribution of your output vector y := Ax; is it in a horizontal or
vertical distribution?
(5pts–Extra credit for CSC5760) Show how to compute z := Ay (where z is stored like x), and A, y
are stored as above.
