/*Problem 4 (28pts):
1. (8pts) Using the results of Problem #1 and #3 to compute the dot product of two distinct vectors of
length M , one stored initially horizontally in linear load-balanced distribution, and one stored initially
vertically in linear load-balanced distribution. The scalar result should be in all processes at the end
of the computation.
