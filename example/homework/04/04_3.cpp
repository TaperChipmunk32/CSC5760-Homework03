/*Problem 4 (28pts):
3. (12pts) Compute the Matrix-vector product of an M × N matrix A stored on the P × Q grid with
linear load-balanced rows and columns with a vector of length N stored horizontally over the same
process topology. Explain the distribution of your output vector y := Ax; is it in a horizontal or
vertical distribution?
(5pts–Extra credit for CSC5760) Show how to compute z := Ay (where z is stored like x), and A, y
are stored as above.
